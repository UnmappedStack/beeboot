# Beeboot

A crappy UEFI bootloader I am trying to write because I'm bored.

For the sake of your sanity, there is a copy of the UEFI firmware in this repo (`uefi-image.fd`) so you don't have to spend ages trying to find one like I did.

It doesn't really do much yet. It uses POSIX-UEFI.

## Some UEFI notes for myself

Note that these page numbers are overall pages of the PDF, not the page numbers at the bottom right of the pages.

- Page 72 of the UEFI specification is the *runtime services*
- Page 151 of the UEFI specification is the *boot services*
